# CPR_Waveform_Segmentation_PostDoc_Application_Suranjan_Ottikkutti
This repository details a machine learning approach to segment diastolic &amp; systolic points in arterial waveforms during CPR. The task addresses challenges in waveform analysis during chest compressions. Data includes 6,800 labeled segments. This demonstrates my ability to apply ML to physiological signal analysis.
